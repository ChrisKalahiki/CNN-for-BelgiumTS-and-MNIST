# CNN for BelgiumTS and MNIST
This repository contains a CNN or convolutional neural network in Python with the intention of identifying the 62 categories of street signs in the BelgiumTS data set.

Inside the CNN folder, you will find three different CNNs. The neural network created for this experiment was implemented with and without a GUI. Additionally, we created a CNN in the same fashion to work with the MNIST dataset that will be discussed later on.
